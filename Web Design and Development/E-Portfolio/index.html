					<h2>About Me</h2>
				
					<p>Currently a student of Manchester Metropolitan University undergoing a BSc in Computer Science, I'm an optimistic and energetic individual who came a long way home from Malaysia. I have a passion for video games, technology and anything related to food. </p>

					<h2>Why I'm Here</h2>
					
					<p>I've come here to Manchester for various reasons. One of my main reasons for moving here is that I wanted to experience the difference of living in a different country. Having travelled a lot before hand to countries such as Japan, France and Turkey, I've seen a lot of surface level diffferences in culture, mentality and attitude but visiting somewhere and living somewhere are two different things.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>Another reason for me moving out is to detach myself from dependencies. I wanted to rely less on my parents and become more independant by learning and developing life skills such as self-organization, cleaning, cooking, laundry and budgeting. While I am not completely lacking in these skills, I wasn't particularly competent at a lot of them due to my reliance on my parents. Living alone also helps me try to get my footing at my own pace instead of having to live up to the standards of my parents. </p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>And so, I've set off to study here in Manchester. It's been around a month since I've first set foot here and I already feel like I've grown a lot. My cooking skills have grown considerably and I'm no longer a slob and try to keep my work and living spaces clean and organized. I've also learned a lot about how British people live and act and it has been a very enlightening experience that made me learn a lot about how different it is between here and Malaysia..</p>
