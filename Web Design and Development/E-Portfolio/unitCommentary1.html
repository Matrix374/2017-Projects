					<h2>Introduction to Web Design & Development</h2>
					
					<p>As the name suggests, this unit covers the design and development of web pages. In this unit we learn how to use HTML and CSS, basic web design fundamentals and making a website useable and accessible. Further along, the unit will cover the usage of Javascript within the website.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>HTML, CSS and Javascript are one of the basic languages one could acquire. HTML and CSS in particular are not very difficult to learn but having it in your list of languages that you could use helps make you more marketable to employers. Javascript on the other hand is a versatile scripting language that can be used alongside many other languages.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>However, what's really interesting about this unit is that we are building an e-portfolio as part of our coursework. This will prove useful when we will start to apply for our placements and jobs as the groundwork for our portfolio will already be done inside this coursework.</p>

					<h2>Programming</h2>
					
					<p>The programming unit covers the basics of making programs using Java and problem solving. In this unit, we learn the fundamental basics of how a programming language works and how to utilize Java to solve problems.
					</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>Java is one of the most sought after skills people look for in prospective employees. It is one of the most widely used programming language in software development therefore demand for this skill is very high. </p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>The coursework for this unit is quite interesting as we have to make a clone of a game with what we've learned. I've done programming courses before but even though covering such problems is familiar to me, it's much more engaging to do problem solving for something like making a game.</p>
